Generally, there was implemented communication program. 
Although the communication is performed on UDP protocol, it is reliable (every data packet is acknowledged by receiving side). The ARQ method is Stop-and-wait. This implementation handles network cutoffs by resending packet for a defined number of times. It also keeps the connection after file or message was sent and shows when connection is terminated. The program can send files of any size, because only one fragment is stored at a time. Usage of checksum provides the correctness of transmitted fragments. User can change the listening port on current side, IP address and port of opposite side during one program run and there is no requirement to restart it.
