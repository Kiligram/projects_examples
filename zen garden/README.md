Task definition - http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~kapustik/zen.html

The main goal is find the solution for zen garden game. In this case brute force approach would take enormous amount of time, but this app uses evolutionary algorithm that finds the correct solution in less than 10 seconds.

An evolutionary algorithm uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions. Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

The map of the garden and parameters such as mutation chance, generation size, number of the best individuals that will be moved to the new generation without roulette are easily editable, so that it is possible to make various experiments. Currently, mentioned parameters are set to the optimal values, that were defined by multiple experiments, that are described in the documentation.
